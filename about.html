      critical issue of urban air quality and provide a user-friendly platform for monitoring and tracking air quality
      metrics.</p>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>Our vision is to make a positive impact on urban communities by providing a tool that not only educates
      individuals about air quality
      but also encourages collective efforts towards a healthier environment. We aim to engage citizens,
      environmentalists, health
      professionals, and government agencies in this crucial initiative.</p>
